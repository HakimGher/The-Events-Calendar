# the calendar events 
finalisation
An event calendar developed using PHP and AJAX is a website that allows users to view a calendar and add events to it. The calendar can be displayed in different views such as monthly, weekly, and daily. The user interface will typically include navigation controls to switch between views and to move to different dates.
Users can add events by clicking on the specific date or by using a form to input the event details such as title, location, start and end time and description. The events will then be displayed on the calendar view, with the ability to edit or delete the events.
The use of AJAX allows the website to dynamically update the calendar without needing to refresh the page, this provides a better user experience and faster navigation on the website.
